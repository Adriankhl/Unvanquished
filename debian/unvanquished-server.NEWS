unvanquished-server (0.24.0-1~~) unstable; urgency=low

  If you've installed (unmanaged) files in /var/games/unvanquished/main,
  these will be ignored. You may move them to /var/games/unvanquished.pkg;
  you may have to rename some when doing so.

  Upgrading from older than 0.5.0 is no longer supported.
